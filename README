Overview
=========
POLARIS provides libraries and tools to help transportation 
engineers to create transportation system simulations. 
In particular to simulate a Traffic Management 
Center along with ITS infrastructure. 
It provides implementation of vented models 
in transportation community so that those 
can be reused by application developers.

Building Using Cmake
--------------------
You can download cmake from here [here](http://www.cmake.org/files/v2.8/cmake-2.8.12-win32-x86.zip "cmake").
Make sure it is added to the PATH

Open CmakeLists.txt and make sure that BOOST_ROOT is set up properly

run the following commands:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G"Visual Studio 10 Win64" ..
This will generate a polaris.sln file you can open in Visual Studio 10
Switch to MinSizeRel and build



POLARIS Dependencies
--------------------
Here is the list of dependencies:
* Boost 1.54
* gperftools-2.1
* odb-2.2.2
* odb-qlite-2.2.2
* sqlite3
* spatialite4
In addition to the dependencies above, if you would like to build an application that uses the graphical
front end of Polaris - Antares, you will need to have the following dependencies
* wxWidgets-2.9.3
* plplot
* glew-1.7.0
Also, if you wold like to compile unit tests, you will need to have
* gtest-1.7.0

We do distribute compiled all of the dependencies for a windows machine,
so you do not have to go through pain of downloading/installing those.
You can download compiled dependencies from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/polaris-t/files/latest/download?source=files "Dependencies for Windows").
Extract to c:\opt. The binaries provided in the polarisdeps folder are compiled for x64 platform. Make sure you build an application for an x64 platform as well.

We've tested the application on a 64-bit windows 8/7 machines. We haven't tested it under any of Linux platforms yet.

There is a convenience polaris_env-x64.bat script that appends all of the paths with necessary dlls to the PATH varaible so those can be found when you run an application.
